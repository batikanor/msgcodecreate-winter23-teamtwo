# Set-Up
## General
* Start two different (integrated) terminals. You will use one for backend, and the other for frontend.

## Backend
* You need to install the requirements using 
`pip install -r requirements txt`, then, you can run the flask backend using `flask run` command. You now have the back-end running. You can test it via clicking the link that has now appeared in the terminal.

## Frontend
* Run `node -v` and `npm -v` to make sure they are installed. Then, enter the client folder and run `yarn install`. Then run `yarn run`. As you can see, this project that was set up with vite provides you four project commands that you can also find inside `package.json`. To run the frontend, you need to run `yarn dev`. You now have the front-end running. You can test it via clicking the link that has now appeared in the terminal.
